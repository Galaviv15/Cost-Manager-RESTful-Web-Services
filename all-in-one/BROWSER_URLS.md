# Browser URLs for Testing

All URLs are for the deployed service on Render. The service uses a gateway that routes all requests through a single port.

Base URL: `https://cost-manager-restful-web-services-u68h.onrender.com`

For local testing, use: `http://localhost:3000` (or the port your service is running on)

- **124 budgets** (for users 1-20, across 12 months and 2 years)
- **10,000+ costs** (income and expenses for all users)

## Notes

1. **For POST/PUT/DELETE requests**, you'll need to use tools like:
   - Postman
   - Insomnia
   - cURL
   - Browser extensions (like REST Client)

2. **Local Testing**: If running locally, replace the base URL with `http://localhost:3000` (or your local port)

3. **User IDs**: The seed data creates users with IDs 1-20, so use those IDs in your queries.

4. **Query Parameters**: Some endpoints require query parameters (like `userid`). Make sure to include them in the URL.

5. **All services are accessible through the same base URL** - no need to specify different ports. The gateway service routes requests to the appropriate handlers.

6. **Health Check**: Visit the root URL (`/`) to see all available services and verify the service is running.
